# PHP-IRCd

An IRC server written in sloppy PHP.

Various basic features are implemented
such as mode and membership tracking and some /OPER commands.

The latest commits here require PHP 8.
See below table for older PHP versions.

## History

This codebase was created during my high school career
and first uploaded to SourceForge in April 2008
(when I was ~15 years old).
Originally, the code targetted PHP 5.2.0 on Windows.

It was not good code.

I don't support this project, but
since then several people have made contributions
to work on some of the bugs or support newer PHP versions.

Here are some permalinks into the different snapshots:
